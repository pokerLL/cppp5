ECE 590–Object Oriented Programming & Machine LearningSummer2025Project 1: NumPy and EasyNNDue: Sunday, June8th, 2025,11:59 PMBeijing TimeI.SummaryIn  this project,  we  will  implement  a few  functions  in  Python  to  learn  the  basics  of NumPy  and EasyNN.  NumPy  is  a  popular  Python  package  for  scientific  computing.  It  is  used  in  our  course projects to create a reference design forour machine learning library EasyNN. As we will discuss in the  lecture,  EasyNN  allows  us  to  define  and  capture  a  data-flow  graph  (DFG)  in  Python  to represent a complex computation, e.g. a machine learning algorithm, and to evaluate the DFG with given inputs.This project should be done individually. Discussions are encouraged. However, all the programs (except  those  from  the  lectures)  and  writings  should  be  by  yourself.  COPY  without  proper CITATION will be treated as PLAGIARISM and called for DISCIPLINARY ACTION.II.Working with Your ProjectsPlease read the ECE 590 Guide to System Setup and Workflow PDFbefore starting work on your projects and follow the instructions there to obtain the initial project package.Here is a brief introduction of the files we will use for Project 1.•easynn.py: Thisis the  EasyNN  library  that  allows  you  to  define  and  capture  DFGs  in Python. You should not modify this file.•easynn_golden.py: This is the reference design of the EasyNN library based on NumPy. You should not modify this file.•prj01.py:This file includes 10 Python functions that you need to implement. You will need to modify this file.•grade_p1.py:This is the grading script to locally verify if your implementations in prj01.py are correct or not. You should not modify this file.•ece449.code-workspace: This is used by VS Code to locate your projectSimply runthe grading script to see if all functions pass:python3 grade_p1.pyPlease  do  not  modify  grade_p1  when  testing  your  code  as  your  grades will  be  tested  with the original grade_p1 file provided to you from the initial git repository.
ECE 590–Object Oriented Programming & Machine LearningSummer2025III.Deliverables and GradingWe obtain a copy of your source file prj01.pyas you push the changes to the central DasanGit repository so there is no need for you to submit it to us using any other mechanisms. Please be advised that since learning the use of Git is among the objectives of this course, we will NOT accept project submissions outside the central DasanGit repository, e.g. via emails. If you have difficulty accessing the centralDasanGit repository, it is your responsibility to act promptly to seek help from us well before the project deadlines; otherwise, not being able to access the central DasanGit repository is NOT an excuse for late submissions.Project 1will have a full grade of 100 points.  Each function, if passed, will give you  10 points. A failed function will earn 0 points.Please make sure that git push your latest code to the DasanGit  repository for  proper  grading  considerations.Note that there is no report  required  for this project.•Run python3 grade_p1.pyin VM to make sure all 10tests pass.•Commit and push your changes to the DasanGit repository.
